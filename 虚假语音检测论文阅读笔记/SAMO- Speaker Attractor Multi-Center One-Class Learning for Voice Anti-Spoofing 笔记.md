<!-- Voice anti-spoofing systems are crucial auxiliaries for automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems. A major challenge is caused by unseen attacks empowered by advanced speech synthesis tech- nologies. Our previous research on one-class learning has improved the generalization ability to unseen attacks by compacting the bona fide speech in the embedding space. However, such compactness lacks consideration of the diversity of speakers. In this work, we propose speaker attractor multi-center one-class learning (SAMO), which clusters bona fide speech around a number of speaker attrac- tors and pushes away spoofing attacks from all the attractors in a high-dimensional embedding space. For training, we propose an algorithm for the co-optimization of bona fide speech clustering and bona fide/spoof classification. For inference, we propose strategies to enable anti-spoofing for speakers without enrollment. Our pro- posed system outperforms existing state-of-the-art single systems with a relative improvement of 38% on equal error rate (EER) on the ASVspoof2019 LA evaluation set. -->

## Introduction
<!-- Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are essential for voice-based authentication that can recognize individuals through speech. With the rise of advanced voice conversion and speech synthesis techniques, ASV technologies are susceptible to possible spoofing attacks, especially logical access (LA) attacks with syn- thetic speech [1, 2]. To tackle such vulnerability in ASV systems, a growing focus has been paid to spoofing countermeasure (i.e., CM or anti-spoofing) systems that often instrument deep learning models to differentiate speech spoken by humans (i.e., bona fide speech) and synthesized speech (i.e., spoofing attacks) [2]. -->
<!-- Existing research on speech anti-spoofing investigated different embedding extractions. Recent end-to-end models have shifted from hand-crafted features such as LFCC [3] and CQCC [4, 5] to raw waveforms, achieving state-of-the-art performance [6, 7, 8, 9]. Other efforts have focused on training strategies, such as data augmenta- tion [10, 11] and multi-task learning [12]. Despite the impressive results, the main challenge remains on the generalization ability to unseen attacks, i.e., spoofing attacks generated by speech synthesis techniques that are not used in generating training data [1]. While this is a pressing issue due to the rapid development of speech syn- thesis techniques, most cutting-edge anti-spoofing systems do not explicitly address this problem. -->
1. 现有虚假检测方法的主要再挑战在于对未知攻击的泛化能力
<!-- To address this generalization problem, in our prior work, we proposed the one-class learning approach [13] that tries to com- pact the bona fide speech into a cluster in the learned embedding space while pushing away spoofing attacks from this cluster. This approach has shown significant improvement in the generalization ability to unseen spoofing attacks [13]. However, due to the variety of timbre and speaking traits of different speakers, we have found that the bona fide speech of different speakers naturally forms mul- tiple clusters in the embedding space. We argue that compacting different speakers into one cluster according to our original formu- lation [13] may have caused some misclassification of the spoofing attacks [14]. For instance, as shown in Figure 1(a), unseen spoofing attacks may lie in between multiple naturally separated clusters of bona fide speech, and compacting bona fide speech into a cluster is likely to coerce the spoofing attack samples into the cluster as well. It would make more sense to maintain the natural clustering of bona fide speech while pushing away spoofing attacks, as shown in (b). -->
2. 之前的 one-class 方法，由于不同 speaker 的 timbre 和 speaking traits 多样性，不同 speaker 的真实语音会形成多个 cluster，而将不同 speaker 的真实语音压缩到一个 cluster 会导致一些误分类，如图：

<!-- In this work, we propose speaker attractor multi-center one-class learning (SAMO) to model speaker diversity while maintaining the generalization ability brought by one-class learning. We aim to find a speech representation for anti-spoofing that not only discriminates bona fide speech from spoofing attacks but also clusters bona fide speech according to speakers. After training, this model can be deployed to test speakers with or without enrollment utterances: With enrollment, the test utterance can be compared to the en- rollment utterances for being classified into bona fide or spoofing attacks; Without enrollment, the test utterance can be compared to the learned attractors from training. The proposed system achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art single systems on the ASVspoof2019 LA dataset, suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed SAMO scheme. -->
3. 提出 SAMO，旨在在保持 one-class 泛化能力的同时，模拟 speaker 多样性；目标是找到一种语音表征，不仅可以区分真实语音和虚假语音，还可以根据说话人对真实语音进行聚类
