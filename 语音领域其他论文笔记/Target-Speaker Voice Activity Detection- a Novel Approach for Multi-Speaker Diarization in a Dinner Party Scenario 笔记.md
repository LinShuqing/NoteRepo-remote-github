<!-- Speaker diarization for real-life scenarios is an extremely chal- lenging problem. Widely used clustering-based diarization ap- proaches perform rather poorly in such conditions, mainly due to the limited ability to handle overlapping speech. We propose a novel Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) ap- proach, which directly predicts an activity of each speaker on each time frame. TS-VAD model takes conventional speech features (e.g., MFCC) along with i-vectors for each speaker as inputs. A set of binary classification output layers produces ac- tivities of each speaker. I-vectors can be estimated iteratively, starting with a strong clustering-based diarization. We also extend the TS-VAD approach to the multi- microphone case using a simple attention mechanism on top of hidden representations extracted from the single-channel TS- VAD model. Moreover, post-processing strategies for the pre- dicted speaker activity probabilities are investigated. Experi- ments on the CHiME-6 unsegmented data show that TS-VAD achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming the baseline x- vector-based system by more than 30% Diarization Error Rate (DER) abs. -->
